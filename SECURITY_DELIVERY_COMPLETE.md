   ├─ If developer leaves → credentials on their machine
   └─ If laptop stolen → all secrets exposed
```

### Solution (After Remediation)
```
✅ Clean Git History
   ├─ All secrets removed from commits
   ├─ History verified clean
   └─ Backup available for recovery

✅ New Credentials in Place
   ├─ Old credentials disabled
   ├─ New credentials active
   └─ All services verified working

✅ Prevention Installed
   ├─ Pre-commit hooks active
   ├─ Manual commits blocked
   ├─ Large files blocked
   └─ Pattern detection active
