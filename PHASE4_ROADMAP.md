## 🚨 RISK MANAGEMENT

### Risk 1: Testing Complexity
```
Description: Jest setup takes longer than expected
Probability: Medium (30%)
Impact: High (5 days delay)
Mitigation:
├─ Use pre-built Jest config template
├─ Start with simple tests
├─ Get help if stuck >1 day
└─ Consider pairing session

Contingency: Skip optional E2E tests, focus on unit/integration
```

### Risk 2: Docker Issues
```
Description: Docker config doesn't work in all environments
Probability: Low (20%)
Impact: Medium (3 days delay)
Mitigation:
├─ Test Docker on all target platforms
├─ Start with docker-compose first
├─ Use cloud-provided Docker images
└─ Document environment requirements

Contingency: Provide traditional deployment guide as fallback
```

### Risk 3: Feature Scope Creep
```
Description: New features take longer than estimated
Probability: Medium (35%)
Impact: Medium (7 days delay)
Mitigation:
├─ Lock feature scope at Sprint 3 start
├─ Use feature flags for incomplete features
├─ Review scope weekly
└─ Prioritize core features only

Contingency: Move advanced features to Phase 5
```

### Risk 4: Team Availability
```
Description: Team members become unavailable
Probability: Low (15%)
Impact: High (complete impact)
Mitigation:
├─ Document everything (over-document)
├─ Cross-train team members
├─ Weekly knowledge transfer
└─ Record training sessions

Contingency: All docs ready for self-service, no dependencies
```

### Risk 5: Integration Issues
```
Description: New code breaks existing functionality
Probability: Medium (40%)
Impact: Medium (5 days)
Mitigation:
├─ Comprehensive testing (this roadmap!)
├─ Branch per feature
├─ Code review before merge
└─ Staging environment tests

Contingency: Revert to last working commit, debug in separate branch
```
